title: About

I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Physics from the University of Birmingham
and I'm currently working as a consultant software developer/technical
architect in the UK commodity-trading sector, where I have been
fortunate enough to implement several large scale solutions in F#.

In his spare time, Colin enjoys learning about new technologies
especially ones related functional programming and contributes to
several F# community open source projects. Including

* [Cricket](http://github.com/fsproject/Cricket)
* [FAKE](http://github.com/fsprojects/Fake)
* [FSharp.Data](http://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Data)
