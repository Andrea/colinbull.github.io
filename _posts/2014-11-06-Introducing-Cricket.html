title: Introducting Cricket.
---

<p>Over the last few years, I have been quite taken by the actor model of computing. Although not a silver bullet it does tend to make concurrent programming orders of magnitude easier to reason about. If you have never heard of Actors then an actor as defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">wikipedia</a> is as follows</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Actor model adopts the philosophy that everything is an actor. This is similar to the everyt>hing is an object philosophy used by some object-oriented programming languages, but differs in t>hat object-oriented software is typically executed sequentially, while the Actor model is inheren>tly concurrent.</p>

  <p>An actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:</p>

<ul>
<li>send a finite number of messages to other actors;</li>
<li>create a finite number of new actors;</li>
<li>designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I also encourage you to look at <a href="http://www.erlang.org">Erlang/Elixir</a>, <a href="https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net">Akka</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/orleans/">Orleans</a> and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee370357.aspx"><code>MailboxProcessor&lt;'a&gt;</code> in FSharp.Core</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/fsprojects/Cricket">Cricket</a>, formally FSharp.Actor, is yet another actor framework. Built entirely in F#, Cricket is a lightweight alternative to Akka et. al. To this end it is not as feature rich as these out of the box, but all of the core requirements like location transpancy, remoting, supervisors, metrics and tracing. Other things like failure detection and clustering are in the pipeline it is just a question of time.</p>

<p>Some key links for Cricket:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Cricket">Cricket NuGet package</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The nuget package, contains a single library <code>Cricket.dll</code> and a reference to <a href="https://github.com/nessos/FsPickler">FsPickler</a>, which is used for serailization.</p>

<p>A couple of things are happening in the code above. Firstly, we start an <code>ActorHost</code> which sets up an environment within the current process for the actor to live in. Next we define the actor, we give it a name <code>echo</code> and a body. The body is actually the only thing that is required. If the name is omitted then it is assinged as a <code>Guid</code>. All the body of an actor consists of is a recursive function, that describes how to handle the messages posted to the actor. In this case we simply print a message to the console. Once we have defined the actor we then spawn it using <code>Actor.spawn</code>. After an actor has been spawned it is ready to consume messages. We can send messages directly to the actor by using the <code>ActorRef</code> that is returned by <code>Actor.spawn</code>.</p>

<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="i">echo</span> <span class="o">&lt;--</span> <span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="s">Hello</span><span class="s">,</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="s">from</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="s">Cricket</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
    </pre>


<p>Alternatively we can resolve the actor by name and send the message that way.</p>

<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="s">echo</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">&lt;--</span> <span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="s">Hello</span><span class="s">,</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="s">from</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="s">Cricket</span><span class="s">&quot;</span></pre>
